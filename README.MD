# Advent of Code 2020 Solutions

My personal solution for 2020's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

Made solely for learning purposes, so these solutions are mostly late submissions. Mostly written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), but I'll use C++11 or Java if Rust is not suitable for the problem.

If a solution isn't present, I haven't solved it yet! I'm a moody person when it comes to competitive programming, please be patient.

## Format

Each day's puzzle answer is stored in the respective `day<x>` folder.
Each folder has the following contents:

### main1.<language>

The uncompiled solution for part 1 of the puzzle. Compile and run it by yourself with the compiler, don't be lazy.

### main2.<language>

The uncompiled solution for part 2 of the puzzle. Compile and run it by yourself with the compiler, don't be lazy.

### SOLUTION1.md

Explanation about how to solve the first part of the puzzle, with complexities. If the solution doesn't have an explanation, it's unfinished.

> Link to the problem statement will be provided in this file.

### SOLUTION2.md

Explanation about how to solve the second part of the puzzle, with complexities. If the solution doesn't have an explanation, it's unfinished.
