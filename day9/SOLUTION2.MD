# Solution

We can use the base code from the first part of the problem. As the problem asks us to find the **contiguous** sum of numbers, we can use [window sliding technique](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/window-sliding-technique/) to search efficiently.

### Time Complexity: O(n) -> Window Sliding is O(n)
### Space Complexity: O(n) -> We need to store all the inputs
