[Problem Statement](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4)

Input parsing. The hardest problem for me is the `&str` and `String` problem, which is solved by StackOverflow community [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65200225/how-can-i-split-strings-without-worrying-about-mutable-borrows?noredirect=1#comment115282243_65200225). Thank you StackOverflow!

### Time Complexity: O(n) -> The length of one string input
### Space Complexity: O(1)
